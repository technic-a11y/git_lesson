    <h1>  Extras</h1> 
    
    <p>let's try creating a link to images and links HTML through extra html</p>

<p> This page is about Miscellaneous HTML but you maybe interested in  <a href="images.html">images</a> or <a href="images.html "> links</a></p>

    <!-- The link shows failed success, this is because these links are existing in parent directory but not in the relative folder, and the problem 
     can be solved by using root directory tag ../ -->

     <p> This page is about Miscellaneous HTML but you maybe interested in  <a href="../images.html">images</a> or <a href="../links.html "> links</a></p>

     <!-- root relative links use root/ attribute to relate to whole website and are explicit in nature but not more then absolute ones. -->
    
     <p> This page contains root relative links and are represented as <a href="/">homepage</a></p>

     <h2>Character Sets</h2>

<p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>

<ol>
  <li>bir</li>
  <li>iki</li>
  <li>üç</li>
  <li>dört</li>
  <li>beş</li>
</ol>
<h2> HTML Entities</h2>
<p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp; . You should always
 use html entities [&] for these three characters.</p>

 <p>If you &rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography, &rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
